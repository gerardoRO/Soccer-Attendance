
* For Web Scrapping
** DONE Add dates to soccer games to delineate pre/post covid
** DONE Find COVID guidelines across all leagues

* For EDA
** DONE filter teams that did not play all seasons looked at
*** That way we can accurately compare throughout the years
** DONE instead of looking at teams based on home wins, look at total wins. 
*** That way we can look at the best vs the worst
** DONE Will have to normalize attendance by average attendance, to try to account for "stadium size"
*** Important if we are going to look at a classification based on attendance rather than just covid/no covid
** DONE Repeat violin plot but instead of wins/home wins look at attendance
*** Understand how attendance has changed throughout the years
** DONE Based on the worst performing 5 teams (based on total wins or home wins) see how those teams perform at away games.
*** If they remain the same, then we know the decrease perfomance effect is a home thing, otherwise is overall        
** TODO Use a stat to see if there is a significant change for the poor teams performance in later years. chisquare?
*** Add quantitative results to our analysis


* For Modeling
** TODO Can we predict a home win based on attendance? 
** TODO Repeat the model above, but for top performers vs bottom performers?
